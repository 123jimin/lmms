What is LMMS??
--------------

LMMS aims to be a free alternative to popular (but commercial and closed-
source) programs like FruityLoops, Cubase and Logic giving you the ability of
producing music with your computer by creating/synthesizing sounds, arranging
samples, using effects, playing live with keyboard and much more...

LMMS combines the features of a sequencer-program (pattern-/channel-/
sample-/song-/effect-management) and those of powerful synthesizers and
samplers in a modern, user-friendly and easy to use graphical user-interface.

LMMS is still in heavy development, so with this version please don't expect a
complete, ready and bugfree program!!



Requirements
------------

The most important requirement is for sure a fast computer, so don't try to get
LMMS working on a pentium I with 60 MHz... ;-) Therefore you should have at
least 500 MHz, but for really enjoying LMMS less than 1 GHz makes no sense...


Required libraries:

- multithreaded version of Qt 3.0 (at least 3.2 recommended) or higher (tested
  up to 4.1.0) with devel-files

Optional, but strongly recommended:
- JACK with devel-files
- libvorbis with devel-files
- libalsa with devel-files
- SDL_sound (tested with 0.1.5 & 1.0.1) with devel-files
- SDL with devel-files
- libsamplerate with devel-files
- libsndfile with devel-files
- WINE, WINE-devel-files + header-files from Steinberg SDK

For compiling you should have an up to date GCC with g++.
LMMS has been (successfully) tested under Debian Sarge 3.1 / unstable,
Fedora Core 2-4, and SuSE Linux 9.0-9.3 with Qt 3.[23].x and Qt 4.0.0.
It was compiled using GCC 2.95, 3.3.x, GCC 3.4.x and GCC 4.0.x.

If you have problems with compiling or running LMMS, find any bug or have
suggestions and so on, please feel free to e-mail me (for mail-address see
below)!



Building
--------

See INSTALL for information on how to build LMMS.

Please also take a look at

./configure --help

There you'll see a lot of options which partly might be interesting for you.
For example if you want to build LMMS with VST-support, you have to run
configure with --with-vst switch. Otherwise LMMS support won't be built!



Join LMMS-development
----------------------

If you are interested in LMMS, it's programming, artwork, testing, writing
demo-songs, (and improving this f**** README...) or something like that,
you're welcome to participate on the development of LMMS!

The project-homepage of LMMS, mailingslists and a list of things you can do
can be found at

http://lmms.sourceforge.net


Details on development can be found at

or in the Wiki:

Before coding a new big feature, please ALWAYS post your idea and suggestions
about your feature and about the actual implementation to the
LMMS-devel-mailinglist (lmms-devel@lists.sourceforge.net) and wait for replies!
Maybe there're different ideas, improvements, hints or maybe your feature is
not welcome/needed at the moment (but for sure this will be very seldom).
