Building LMMS got quite simple since 0.4.0 as everything is managed
by cmake now. Therefore make sure you have CMake (>= 2.6.0 recommended) and
then run


mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install


This way an out-of-tree build is performed. You can also run "cmake ." directly
in the root of source-tree although this is not recommended. When performing an
out-of-tree build after there's already an in-tree build, make sure to run
"make distclean" before running cmake inside build-directory.

If you want to use custom compiler flags simply set the environment variables
CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

After running cmake (the 3rd command above) you can see a summary of things
that are going to be built into LMMS or built as plugins. Install the
according libraries and development files if a certain feature is not enabled.
Then remove CMakeCache.txt and run cmake again.
