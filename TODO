- do REAL release in envelopes (can't be precalculated as it depends on key-press-duration/rest of envelope)
- correctly load steps/dots from FLP-files
- vibed-plugin: do not crash at destruction
- convert FL-Plucked!-parameters to Vibed-parameters
- in flp-import-filter: merge play-list-items if possible
- integrated sample-browser in context-menu of sample-track/-tco
- font-size-scaling-coefficient in setup-dialog
- make note able of journalling
- before calling undoStep/redoStep from journallingObject, save journalling-state-context and disabled journalling, restore afterwards
- intelligent journal-entry-merging
- undo/redo-support in note/track etc.
- save tco-settings in trackContentWidget::saveSettings() etc. instead of track::...
- restore stacking-order of windows when loading project
- bristol-bindings
- resample sample-track-tcos when using hq-mode
- add support for panes-interface (like blender) (instead of MDI etc.)
- message to user when importing unsupported MIDI-file (track-count = 0)
- volume-knobs for each sample-track
- AMS/OMS-bindings
- remove binary-embed-system
- recording-functionality
- show loading-vst-hint when cloning vestige-track
- do not hang when saving while loading VST-plugin (because then we call dispatcher while the load-process is still going on)
- tempo-recogn. and sync of beat-samples
- do not quantize when importing from MIDI-file
- separate GUI and data/sound-processing-code
- make color-scheme switchable: LMMS / user
- autosave every 30s (configurable!) and offer recovery at startup after crash
- make piano-roll use rubberband instead of implementing a simple one on it's own
- level-meters in output-graph and channel-track
- do not skip samples because of rounding-errors when resampling in src/lib/sample_buffer.cpp
- MIDI-program/MIDI-mapping/process program-/channel-change-events from MIDI-files
- DSSI-support
- use drawLineF() for drawing notes in pattern::paintEvent() in qt4-version
- only redraw region given by paint-event in pattern, bbTCO, sampleTCO etc.
- pre-listen when opening sample with QFileDialog
- panning-editing in piano-roll
- speed up painting of sampleTCO
- solve problems with different keyboard-layouts when playing channel-track with pc-keyboard -> use tr()
- panning env+lfo
- plucked-string-synth: knob for metallic -> use noise as wave-shape
- finish qt4-port and make LMMS usable when compiling with Qt4
- rewrite export-project-dialog using layout-mechanism
- dynamic pitch-change
- make piano-roll use the global clipboard??
- add more localizations:
	- Swedish
	- Norwegian
	- Greece
	- ...


- effect-board -> live-fx from input
- chord-editor?
- WAVE/OGG/MP3-Import -> FFT-analysis -> write notes
- FLP-Import
- classical note-edit-window -> also ability of printing and maybe later scanning & recognition of notes
- add FLAC as export-format?
