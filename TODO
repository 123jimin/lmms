Andrew Kelley's todo:
- add a tools menu to piano roll
  * put some of the tools on there that already have keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+up/down, shift+left/right)
  * humanizing tool
  * quick slice
  * look through FL Studio's tools and implement some of them
- undo/redo for piano roll
- make copy/paste work beyond inside piano roll - it didn't work when I copied notes from one pattern and then opened another pattern and pasted.
- piano roll: make the note volume section have adjustable height
- add note panning ability to piano roll
- make piano roll grid change based on quantization

- "paintbrush" tool for the song editor, to easily "paint" beat+basslines
- when you clone a track in the song editor, rename the track so that it doesn't have the same name (increment the number if necessary)
- somehow enable easy pattern copy pasting in the beat+bassline editor
- make knobs easier to tune (less sensitive)
- make it so you can see the notes when putting a pattern in the playlist
- make the menu for a channel happen when you right click, instead of renaming, and make the midi input a top-level menu item
- recording automation
- adding/removing steps to the beat+bassline editor is awkward
- the 'add beat+bassline' button in the beat+bassline editor is misleading - I say we remove it and rely on the song editor to add beat+basslines
- make it so that 3xosc notes don't max out
- implement note detuning (used to be ctrl+click to access note detuning) (need some other intuitive way to access note detuning as ctrl, shift, and alt are all being used)
- make the horizontal scroll bar do the same thing as shift+vertical scroll bar
- add a "Set exact value" to a right clicked automation menu
- enable "auto detect" by default when you bring up the "connect to controller" window
