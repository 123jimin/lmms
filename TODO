Version 0.4.5:
- save tco-settings in trackContentWidget::saveSettings() etc. instead of 
  track::...
- restore stacking-order of windows when loading project
- resample sample-track-tcos when using hq-mode
- message to user when importing unsupported MIDI-file (track-count = 0)
- use drawLineF() for drawing notes in pattern::paintEvent() in qt4-version
- only redraw region given by paint-event in pattern, bbTCO, sampleTCO etc.
- piano roll: pencil tool icon doesn't set right. selection arrow cursor
  doesn't set right
- piano roll: mouse cursor isn't updated correctly in selection mode
  (from resizing note edit area)
- when you add vestige, have it automatically pop the find VST plugin dialog

Version 0.4.6:
- speed up painting of sampleTCO
- rewrite export-project-dialog using layout-mechanism
- panning env+lfo?
- do not process effects when playing frozen patterns
- try to make vestige-plugin-dlls relative
- do song-editor-tempo-connection to vst-plugin inside remoteVSTPlugin
- copy-pasted automation patterns have to be manually linked back to
  their knob for some reason

Version 0.9.0:
- select number of channels in export-project-dialog
- replace rest of wizard by simple directory-selection-dialog for 
  working-dir when running the first time
- add/remove-steps button in bb-editor for adding/removing according 
  number of steps to/from all patterns of visible beat/baseline. (translation:
  adding/removing steps to the beat+bassline editor is awkward. Make it more
  like FL Studio)
- the 'add beat+bassline' button in the beat+bassline editor is misleading.
  I say we remove it and rely on the song editor to add beat+basslines
- integrated sample-browser in context-menu of sample-track/-tco
- recording functionality
- remove binary-embed-system (Qt4-resource-system?)
- make piano-roll use rubberband instead of reinventing the wheel
- level-meters in output-graph and instrument-track
- MIDI-program/MIDI-mapping/process program-/channel-change-events 
  from MIDI-files
- make piano-roll use the global clipboard??
- pre-listen when opening sample with QFileDialog
- add FLAC as export format
- load asdlol.mmpz. if you render it without playing it, or if you play it
  the first time, you hear unwanted artifacts. (solution: apply automation
  before playing)
- VST presets don't work. when you save a project, it doesn't even save
  what you did.
- resources browser: if you listen to LB302 presets and then listen to
  Organic presets, segfault
- show instruments in both B+B and song editor. you can't have an instrument
  in one and not another.
- mixer sends
- when you switch the playback option it should immediately switch which thing
  is playing
- automation recording:
	* when you record and there is already an auto clip, it repeats it
	* it freezes when you try to do it with the Volume or Panning slider
	* crashes when you try to do it with a solo/mute button
- enable "auto detect" by default when you bring up the "connect to controller" window

Version 0.9.1
- convert FL-Plucked!-parameters to Vibed-parameters
- correctly load steps/dots from FLP-files
- in flp-import-filter: merge play-list-items if possible
- do not hang when saving while loading VST-plugin (because then we call
  dispatcher while the load-process is still going on)
- add a tools menu to piano roll
	* quantize tool in the piano roll
	* put some of the tools on there that already have keyboard shortcuts
      (ctrl+up/down, shift+left/right)
	* humanizing tool
	* quick slice
	* look through FL Studio's tools and implement some of them
    * chord editor
- VST preset framework. You should be able to load a bunch of presets from some
  VST API call. Additionally it should be easy to load and save VST presets
- show key depresses in the piano roll when you press the key in midi or
  because the song is playing
- copy paste entire pattern in b+b
- when you click and drag a mixer bar, it doesn't click and drag, it sets
  absolutely. this is annoying
- piano roll: don't end mouse selection when control is released

Version 0.9.2
- tempo-recogn. and sync of beat-samples
- right click in b+b should delete notes 
- when you clone a track, it should put it directly below, rename it to #2, and
  not have it in the song
- cloning a track in the song editor should copy automation tracks along
  with notes
- right click on note volume draws a line not deletes notes in the piano roll
- default the graph to On. change the default length to 64 or even 32 but
  make it a setting, whether it's on and how many samples.
- make pitch bend range adjustable

Version 0.9.3
- autosave every 30s (configurable!) and offer recovery at startup after crash
- when a song goes past the end of the song, make it stop or loop
- when looking at a piano roll, if the song is playing that pattern, move
  the position ticker to where it should be. allow user to change the position
  ticker which modifies the song position relatively.
- monophonic mode on 3xosc
- add dithering
- add a "Set exact value" to a right clicked automation menu

Version 1.0.0:
- Redesign undo/redo framework. Make sure every aspect of the program has undo
  and redo support, including song editor, beat+bassline editor, piano roll,
  automation editor, fx mixer, etc.
- option for detached windows for multiple screen users
- make color-scheme switchable: LMMS / user
- add support for panes-interface (like blender) (instead of MDI etc.)
- effect-board -> live-fx from input?
- WAVE/OGG/MP3-Import -> FFT-analysis -> write notes

Version 1.1.0
- "map audio files to piano roll keys" - GoldWave equivalent instrument
	* allow importing goldwave presets
    * this could be integrated with a slicing tool
- classical note-edit-window -> also ability of printing and maybe later
  scanning & recognition of notes
- piano roll: multiview button - show notes from every instrument in the current
  beat+bassline with different colors
- make the menu for a channel happen when you right click, instead of
  renaming, and make the midi input a top-level menu item

Version 1.2.0
- "paintbrush" tool for the song editor, to easily "paint" beat+basslines
- somehow enable easy pattern copy pasting in the beat+bassline editor
- make it so you can see the notes when putting a pattern in the playlist
- make it so that 3xosc notes don't max out
- rethink the mixing technique. maybe mix in such a way that doesn't max out
  quickly.

Version 1.3.0
- bristol-bindings? (bristol.sourceforge.net)
- AMS/OMS-bindings? (alsamodular.sourceforge.net)
- DSSI-support?
