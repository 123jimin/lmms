- arpeggio: send midi-out-events via channel-track
- tooltips for controls in MIDI-tab
- sample-track: sane bg and wave-color
- complete toolbar-redesign in song-editor, bb-editor and piano-roll!!!
- dnd everywhere: presets, samples (afp/sample-track), TCO's, knob-values
- DSSI-support
- move VST-code into separate class which can use several backends (libfst, dssi-vst and vst-server) -> add libfst/dssi-vst/vstserver-check to configure.in
- save/load parameters of VST-plugin
- somehow avoid hidden plugin-descriptor-widgets plugin-browser if height of window is too small -> add scrollbar
- use drawLineF() for drawing notes in pattern::paintEvent() in qt4-version
- pattern freeze -> do not endless loop if looping-points are enabled
- solve problem with knob-control-precision
- add note-len- and note-alignment-selectbox to piano-roll
- only redraw region given by paint-event in pattern, bbTCO, sampleTCO etc.
- make LMMS an ALSA-sequencer-client
	- use midi-maps
	- process program-/channel-change-events from MIDI-files
	- setup MIDI-channel and -program in MIDI-Out
- pre-listen when opening sample with QFileDialog
- level-meters in output-graph and channel-track
- panning-editing in piano-roll
- speed up painting of sampleTCO
- save window-positions, -states and -sizes in files
- solve problems with different keyboard-layouts when playing channel-track with pc-keyboard -> use tr()
- balance env+lfo
- autosave every 1 minute
- audioDummy: always wait until the stuff normally would have been written (=simulate blocking IO)
- plucked-string-synth: knob for metallic -> use noise as wave-shape
- finish qt4-port and make LMMS usable when compiling with Qt4
- rewrite export-project-dialog using layout-mechanism
- dynamic pitch-change
- make piano-roll use the global clipboard??
- add languages:
	- Italian
	- Swedish
	- Norwegian
	- Greece
	- ...



Things to be done anytime in the future
- effect-board -> live-fx from input
- event-system
- chord-editor?
- WAVE/OGG/MP3-Import -> FFT-analysis -> write notes
- FLP-Import
- classical note-edit-window -> also ability of printing and maybe later scanning & recognition of notes
- add FLAC as export-format?
- better commented source...
- optimize, optimize, optimize.....
