Andrew Kelley's todo:
* when you press down or up while browsing the resource browser, it should
  play the sample
* select the output file format based on what you selected in file->save as
* segfault when you export an mp3 and press cancel


- automation recording:
	* when you record and there is already an auto clip, it repeats it
	* it freezes when you try to do it with the Volume or Panning slider
	* crashes when you try to do it with a solo/mute button
- when a song goes past the end of the song, make it stop or loop
- don't end mouse selection when control is released
- add a tools menu to piano roll
	* quantize tool in the piano roll
	* put some of the tools on there that already have keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+up/down, shift+left/right)
	* humanizing tool
	* quick slice
	* look through FL Studio's tools and implement some of them
- adding/removing steps to the beat+bassline editor is awkward
- the 'add beat+bassline' button in the beat+bassline editor is misleading - I say we remove it and rely on the song editor to add beat+basslines
- "map audio files to piano roll keys" - GoldWave equivalent instrument
	* allow importing goldwave presets
- when a note is played, show the note as being depressed in the piano roll
- when song is playing and you switch playback mode it should switch immediately
- pencil tool icon doesn't set right. selection arrow cursor doesn't set right
- when you add VSTi, have it automatically pop the find VST plugin dialog
- make pitch bend range adjustable
- when looking at a piano roll, if the song is playing that pattern, move the position ticker to where it should be
- monophonic mode on 3xosc
- add dithering
- add global playback mode to .mmp file format
- allow increasing the width of song editor things, it will make the BB repeat
- multiview button - show notes from every instrument in the current beat+bassline with different colors
- undo/redo for piano roll
- mouse cursor isn't updated correctly in selection mode (from resizing note edit area)
- make the menu for a channel happen when you right click, instead of renaming, and make the midi input a top-level menu item
- add a "Set exact value" to a right clicked automation menu
- enable "auto detect" by default when you bring up the "connect to controller" window
- "paintbrush" tool for the song editor, to easily "paint" beat+basslines
- when you clone a track in the song editor, rename the track so that it doesn't have the same name (increment the number if necessary)
- somehow enable easy pattern copy pasting in the beat+bassline editor
- make it so you can see the notes when putting a pattern in the playlist
- make it so that 3xosc notes don't max out
- copy-pasted automation patterns have to be manually linked back to their knob for some reason
- cloning a pattern in the song editor should copy automation tracks along with notes
- fix memory leaks
