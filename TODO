to be done as soon as possible:

- do not allow to connect output-port of channel to own input-port!
- save connections in midi-tab-widget
- add note-len- and note-alignment-selectbox to piano-roll
- make it possible in bb-editor to add single beats to beat-patterns
- fix audio/midi-settings stuff/translation
- tooltips for controls in MIDI-tab
- sample-track: sane bg and wave-color
- dnd everywhere: presets, samples (afp/sample-track), TCO's, knob-values
- DSSI-support
- save/load parameters of VST-plugin
- somehow avoid hidden plugin-descriptor-widgets plugin-browser if height of window is too small -> add scrollbar
- use drawLineF() for drawing notes in pattern::paintEvent() in qt4-version
- only redraw region given by paint-event in pattern, bbTCO, sampleTCO etc.
- use midi-maps
- process program-/channel-change-events from MIDI-files
- pre-listen when opening sample with QFileDialog
- level-meters in output-graph and channel-track
- panning-editing in piano-roll
- speed up painting of sampleTCO
- save window-positions, -states and -sizes in files
- solve problems with different keyboard-layouts when playing channel-track with pc-keyboard -> use tr()
- balance env+lfo
- autosave every 1 minute
- audioDummy: always wait until the stuff normally would have been written (=simulate blocking IO)
- plucked-string-synth: knob for metallic -> use noise as wave-shape
- finish qt4-port and make LMMS usable when compiling with Qt4
- rewrite export-project-dialog using layout-mechanism
- dynamic pitch-change
- make piano-roll use the global clipboard??
- add more localizations:
	- Italian
	- Swedish
	- Norwegian
	- Greece
	- ...



to be done somewhen in the future:
- effect-board -> live-fx from input
- event/automation-system
- chord-editor?
- WAVE/OGG/MP3-Import -> FFT-analysis -> write notes
- FLP-Import
- classical note-edit-window -> also ability of printing and maybe later scanning & recognition of notes
- add FLAC as export-format?
