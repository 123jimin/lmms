.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
.B LMMS
aims to be a free alternative to popular (but commercial and closed-source) programs such as FL Studio, Cubase and Logic giving you the ability of producing music with your computer by creating cool loops, synthesizing and mixing sounds and processing effects on them, arranging samples, having fun with your MIDI-keyboard and much more...
 
LMMS combines the features of a sequencer-program (pattern-/channel-/sample-/song-/effect-management) and those of powerful instrument-plugins and plugin-hosters (such as LADSPA and VST) in a modern, user-friendly and easy to use graphical user-interface.
